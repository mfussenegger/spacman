spacman is a very simple wrapper around pacman, pacsearch and aria2c.

Currently there are three modes:

-Ss: 
    passthrough to pacsearch
-S [ y | u | c ]: 
    calls pacman -S --print to get download urls,
    then uses aria2c to download all packages and finally passes the original arguments through to pacman.
Everything else:
    passthrough to pacman

In addition to python, reflector (from xyne-any) and aria2c is required.
